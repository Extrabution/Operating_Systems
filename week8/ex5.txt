Virtual and Phisical memory are different.
Physical is hardware adresses, they are actually exist in our computer.
Virtual memory like a cloud - it is somewhere, but we don't know where. Process 
asks for information but it doesn't know where this information is. Virtual adress transforms to the physical adress and return the place of needed information to the process
